# piVoice
Uses a Raspberry Pi as a hub for a texting-based virtual assistant, driven with PyAutoGUI and Google Voice  
The script requires that the Pi be connected to a 1920x1080 monitor (or be tricked into such conditions using TightVNC), and 
that the Chrome web browser be parted to the left half of the screen. Once this is all setup, the Raspberry Pi can idle 
within the checkMessage state indefinitely.
